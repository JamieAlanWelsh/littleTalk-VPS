        <h3 class="question">Q: Who is this tool for?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: This tool is primarily for parents of children with speech and language needs. The tool is designed to make it easy for parents to practise speech and language development at home through routine exercises.

        <h3 class="question">Q: Do I need to practise daily to see results?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: Research shows that frequent learning is three times more likely to lead to improvement in results. For this reason, we encourage users to practise daily, however, we understand that life can get in the way, so please feel free to practise whenever it suits you and your child - it all counts!</p>

        <h3 class="question">Q: Is this a replacement for speech therapy?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: This tool is intended to be a supplementary/complementary tool to accelerate speech and language development and ensure consistent carryover.

        <h3 class="question">Q: What exercise learning level is right for my learner?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: Colourful Semantics features an <strong>Auto</strong> button which automatically chooses a learning level to get started. Please adjust manually to match your child's needs as you see fit. For our other exercises, start your learner at the lowest learning level and gradually increase the number of choices to match your child's ability.
