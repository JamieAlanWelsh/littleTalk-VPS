        <h3 class="question">Who is Chatterdillo for?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            <strong>This tool is designed for teaching staff and parents supporting children with speech and language needs.</strong> We provide gamified, evidence-based speech and language exercises for children aged 2 to 11. Schools also benefit from a dashboard with progress tracking to keep everyone on the team connected and aligned.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="question">How do you keep my data secure?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            Children’s names are encrypted, ensuring they remain private and accessible only to you. Within schools, we use role-based permissions so that only authorised staff can view child progress and approve access for parents and other staff members. We never share personal information with third parties.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="question">How do I access my Child's account?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            If your school uses Chatterdillo with your child, you can request a secure <strong>Parent-Access-Code</strong> from a school staff member. Once you've received a code, head on over to <a href="/parent-signup/" class="text-link" target="_blank">Parent-Signup</a> to get connected. Be sure to input your code when signing up!

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="question">Can Chatterdillo support speech sounds?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            We do not currently support speech sound disorders or speech sound development. If you are working with a child who is potentially struggling with a speech sound disorder, we advise seeking out of local Speech and Language Therapy services.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="question">Is this a replacement for Speech and Language Therapy?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            While Chatterillo is a great way to supplement and accellerate children's language development, it should not be considered a replacement for Speech and Language Therapy. We encourage anyone with speech and language needs to continue seeking traditional Speech and Language Therapy services in addition to using our platform.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="question">Does Chatterdillo require adult supervision?</h3>
        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
            Yes! Chatterdillo is designed to be used with your child in a playful, interactive way. The best results come when language is consistently modelled and reinforced with the support of an adult. Not sure what “modelling language” means? Don’t worry, we’ll guide you as you go!
