            <h3 class="question">Q: Who is this tool for?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A: This tool is primarily for parents of children with speech and language needs. The tool is designed to make it easy for parents to practise speech and language development at home through routine exercises.

            <h3 class="question">Q: How should the app be used?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A: The app should be used in collaboration with your child. Add a "learner" in the profile section to get started. We will suggest exercises for your child based on your initial assessment. We recommend practise little and often, around 10-15 minutes a day.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Q: Do I need to practise daily to see results?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A: Research shows that frequent learning is three times more likely to lead to improvement in results. For this reason, we encourage users to practise daily, however, we understand that life can be busy, so please feel free to practise whenever it suits you and your child - it all counts!</p>

            <h3 class="question">Q: Is this a replacement for speech therapy?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A: This tool is intended to be a supplementary/complementary tool to accelerate speech and language development. The team at LittleTalk encourages anyone with speech and language needs to continue seeking traditional speech therapy services in addition to using our service.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Q: How should I pick exercise learning level?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A: A good rule of thumb is to start your learner at the lowest learning level and add complexity to find the right level for your learner. Even at lower levels, practise will still be beneficial in helping with carryover and confidence, so relax and take the opportunity to ease into the programme with your learner.</p>
