                I'm a licensed Speech and Language Therapist and co-founder of Chatterdillo.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">           
                In schools, it can be frustrating when a child is struggling to communicate and staff arenâ€™t sure where to begin, how to offer the right support, or feel stuck waiting for external input.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">
                I first experienced this while working as a one-to-one assistant, supporting a child with Downâ€™s Syndrome. I was given a pack of speech and language exercises without any guidance on how to implement them. Even with my training, I felt unsure and anxious because I cared deeply about doing the right thing. That experience helped me understand how overwhelming it can be for school staff who want to help but donâ€™t have the tools or support.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">
                This is why we created Chatterdillo: to empower educators with accessible, evidence-based resources that make it easy to build childrenâ€™s speech and language skills in the classroom, with confidence and clarity.

                Using the app for just 10 minutes a day with my 2 year old has made a real difference. He is much more interested in trying to speak, even if the words arenâ€™t always clear yet. Weâ€™ve seen some early successes, but most importantly, his motivation to talk and engage has grown massively. He loves the interactive activities and he always laughs at the voice on the app while trying his best to copy it. Itâ€™s become a fun part of our day.
