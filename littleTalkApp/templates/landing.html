                We introduced Chatterdillo to support children identified with speech and language needs and the impact has been incredible! Our students WANT to go on Chatterdillo, they find it fun, engaging, and itâ€™s made a real difference in their progress! Itâ€™s so user-friendly and the support from the Chatterdillo team is fantastic. I would absolutely recommend it to other schools, itâ€™s a fantastic resource for classroom and SEND support.

                Using the app for just 10 minutes a day with my 2 year old has made a real difference. He is much more interested in trying to speak, even if the words arenâ€™t always clear yet. Weâ€™ve seen some early successes, but most importantly, his motivation to talk and engage has grown massively. He loves the interactive activities and he always laughs at the voice on the app while trying his best to copy it. Itâ€™s become a fun part of our day.
