            Iâ€™m a licensed Speech and Language Therapist and co-founder of LittleTalk SLT.

            It can be really frustrating when your child is struggling to communicate, but youâ€™re not sure where to begin, how to get support, or feel stuck waiting for help.
        </p>
        <p class="split-body">
            I first experienced this while working as a one-to-one assistant, supporting a child with Downâ€™s Syndrome. I was handed a pack of speech and language exercises, but with no guidance or support on how to implement them. Even as a professional, I felt unsure and panicked because I cared deeply about getting it right. That experience made me realise how overwhelming it must be for parents facing the same thing.
        </p>
        <p class="split-body">
            This is why we created LittleTalk - to empower parents with the tools and confidence to build their childâ€™s speech and language from home, at their own pace.
