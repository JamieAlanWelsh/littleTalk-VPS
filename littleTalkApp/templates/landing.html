            <p class="split-body">
                I’m a licensed Speech and Language Therapist and co-founder of LittleTalk.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">           
                It can be really frustrating when your child is struggling to communicate, but you’re not sure where to begin, how to get support, or feel stuck waiting for help.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">
                I first experienced this while working as a one-to-one assistant, supporting a child with Down’s Syndrome. I was handed a pack of speech and language exercises, but with no guidance or support on how to implement them. Even as a professional, I felt unsure and panicked because I cared deeply about getting it right. That experience made me realise how overwhelming it must be for parents facing the same thing.
            </p>
            <p class="split-body">
                This is why we created LittleTalk - to empower parents with the tools and confidence to build their child’s speech and language from home, at their own pace.

                Since using the app around 10 mins every day, my daughter has taken a huge interest in trying to say the words and even though they may not be clear she has definitely made an effort and really does try her best. We have had a couple of successes in a couple of words but her interest in wanting to talk and engage is huge. She finds using the app on my phone fun dragging the words to the boxes. She also finds the lady’s voice funny and tries her best to repeat what she says.
